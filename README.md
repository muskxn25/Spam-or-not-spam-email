The SpamAssassin Public Corpus dataset is a well-known dataset used for training and evaluating spam detection algorithms. It was created by the SpamAssassin project, an open-source project aimed at developing tools to identify and filter out spam emails. Here is an explanation of the dataset, including its structure and contents:

**Dataset Structure**
The SpamAssassin Public Corpus dataset is organized into several directories, each containing a different type of email. The main directories are:

**easy_ham**: This directory contains "ham" emails, which are legitimate (non-spam) emails that are relatively easy to distinguish from spam. These emails are typical of what you might find in a normal inbox.

**hard_ham**: This directory contains "ham" emails that are more difficult to distinguish from spam. These emails may contain content that is similar to spam or have other characteristics that make them challenging to classify correctly.

**spam_2**: This directory contains additional spam emails. These emails were added later to expand the dataset.

Each directory contains several files, with each file representing a single email. The emails are stored in plain text format and include the full email content, including headers and body.

Machine Learning Algorithm Used here is: 
**Naive Bayes**
